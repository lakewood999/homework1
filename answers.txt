What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Answer: A merge combines changes from two branches into one via a new "merge commit" onto the target branch, leaving the original commits and overall structure of each branch intact (except for the new "merge commit" on the target branch). On the other hand, a rebase achieves a similar goal of combining changes, but by combining the commits of the two branches into a single timeline/squashing two separate commit streams into one and eliminating one of the branches, rather than using a new, separate "merge commit" to reconcile the changes onto the target branch. Essentially, rebase is more "destructive" than merge and interweaves commits into a single timeline rather than creating a new separate commit that reconciles differences.
