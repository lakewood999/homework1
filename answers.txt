What is a remote repository?

Answer: A remote repository is essentially the same thing as a local repository, but it resides on another server accessible via network rather than the local storage medium. A local repository can point to a remote repository and interact with it as a means of collaboration, where the local repository can "push" local commits upstream to the remote repository and "pull"/"fetch" any changes made on the remote repository down to the local one (among other tools and features). Obviously, with these mechanisms, various developers with their own local repositories can collaborate on changes. One example use case is Github: a Github repository is a remote repository that can be interacted with directly via web interface, or via a local version pointing to the remote one retrieved using "git clone".
