What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Answer: A merge combines changes from two branches into one via a new "merge commit" onto the target branch, leaving the original commits and overall structure of each branch intact (except for the new "merge commit" on the target branch). On the other hand, a rebase achieves a similar goal of combining changes, but by combining the commits of the two branches into a single timeline/squashing two separate commit streams into one and eliminating one of the branches, rather than using a new, separate "merge commit" to reconcile the changes onto the target branch. Essentially, rebase is more "destructive" than merge and interweaves commits into a single timeline rather than creating a new separate commit that reconciles differences.
What is a remote repository?

Answer: A remote repository is essentially the same thing as a local repository, but it resides on another server accessible via network rather than the local storage medium. A local repository can point to a remote repository and interact with it as a means of collaboration, where the local repository can "push" local commits upstream to the remote repository and "pull"/"fetch" any changes made on the remote repository down to the local one (among other tools and features). Obviously, with these mechanisms, various developers with their own local repositories can collaborate on changes. One example use case is Github: a Github repository is a remote repository that can be interacted with directly via web interface, or via a local version pointing to the remote one retrieved using "git clone".
